Lockdown for myself was fairly standard. I found access to services and amenities greatly reduced, got very fatigued with zoom calls and quizzes after a couple of weeks, became slightly more active for a month, and stressed about family, friends and the state of things.

Once pubs reopened I worked at a local GreeneKing inn where I tend to work in between Semesters to make ends meet. Thanks to being part of a national chain COVID procedures were in place which was reassuring considering the village where I worked was a very busy tourist trap where the visitors where not exactly worried about COVID.

Working there was okay. Stressful particularly during the busy times (of which there were many) and the few occasions when we had problems with drunk/rude people. EatOutToHelpOut was not incredibly helpful in that regard (sales-wise we were on par with last year even before EO2HO was announced) in that we were already reaching max capacity of guests, so the only change we saw was that the general clientele got ruder and less cooperative with safety measures.

In general keeping on top of my wellbeing was difficult given the lack of access to any services, and the stresses from the situation, world events and work, but the prescence of family was a great help. At the time of writing this post, my last working day will be Friday 18th September, so that I can go back up to Birmingham on the weekend in time for term starting on the 21st.
