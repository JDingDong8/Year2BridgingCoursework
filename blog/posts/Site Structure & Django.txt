A post discussing how your site is structured and in your own words a description of how Django works.


General points:

<ul>
    <li>While trying to setup the whole dark mode schtick, had a bit of trouble with trying to minimise spaghetti code while toggleing all the various elements to their dark mode forms</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Was going to name toggleable classes something starting with a particular string e.g. default-page-header, then use document.querySelector(class^="default") to get a list of everything that needed to toggle. But unfortunately since need to change classes by hand doesn't really save time unless I knew a lot more about javascript and css fancy stuff
    </ul>
</ul>
