A post reflecting on what youâ€™ve enjoyed studying this year

General points:

<ul>
    <li>Start of the year was okay then got a bit fucked in ass by the ol mental health</li>
    <li>Particularly bad from Jan onwards. Mental health services not particularly helpful 'cept that one nurse who gave me a bunch of wound tape & dressing</li>
    <li>Would like to have been more engaged with Security module as well as C/C++/Sytems Engineering</li>
    <li>Software Engineering was utter dogshit</li>
    <li>My group (including myself) had a bunch of trouble for the team project that never got resolved, tried to rejoin group halfway through with help from module head but basically got told to politely go away (fair nough tbh)</li>
    <li>Might've been nice to have a few foundational lectures before team project rather than e.g. having to figure out multiplayer netcode for a video game while the only internet stuff we've done has been a basical rundown of http & a small java demo sending hello world across a local network</li>
</ul>
