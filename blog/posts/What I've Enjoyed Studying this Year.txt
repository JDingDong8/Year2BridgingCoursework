I'll preface this by saying that I've struggled a lot with my mental health this year. Unfortunately I haven't found mental health services nor University Wellbeing helpful. As a result of this I've not engaged anywhere near as much as I'd like with serveral of my modules, which is a shame since I was looking forward to a few of them.

September 2019 Jonathan was particularly looking forward to the Systems Programming in C/C++, and the Security and Networks module. I'd heard good things about these modules from a friend who studied here a few years ago, and they generally looked interesting. Was especially looking forward to the very practical nature of the assignments for the Security module.

Other things to remark that didn't go as well as planned were the group projects in Semester 1 and 2. I don't think anyone particularly enjoyed Software Engineering, but in particular during the team project for Semester 2 I was engaged at the start but lost contact with my group as mental health worsened. I later tried to reestablish contact & see if I could help out at all but it was rather late at this point and I basically was politely told to go away, which was fair.

And then lockdown happened, although thankfully towards the end of the second Semester
